                            <b>PHP</b> is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development.[7] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[8] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[9] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[8] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[10]
                            PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[11] and robotic drone control.[12] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.
                            The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.[13]
                            The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.[14]
                            W3Techs reports that, as of January 2022, "PHP is used by 78.1% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know."[15] PHP version 7.4 is the most used version. Support for version 7.3 was dropped on 6 December 2021.

                            PHP development began in 1994 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C,[16][17] which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.
                            PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. To accelerate bug reporting and improve the code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as "Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0" on the Usenet discussion group comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on June 8, 1995.[1][18] This release already had the basic functionality that PHP has today. This included Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed HTML. The syntax resembled that of Perl, but was simpler, more limited and less consistent.
                            Early PHP was not intended to be a new programming language, and grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: "I don't know how to stop it, there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept adding the next logical step on the way."[20] A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997.
                            The fact that PHP was not originally designed, but instead was developed organically has led to inconsistent naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters.[21] In some cases, the function names were chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was "wrapping",[22] while in some very early versions of PHP the length of the function names was used internally as a hash function, so names were chosen to improve the distribution of hash values.

                            Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3, changing the language's name to the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[9][24] Afterwards, public testing of PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999.[25] They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel.[9]
                            On 22 May 2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released.[9] By August 2008, this branch had reached version 4.4.9. PHP 4 is now no longer under development and nor are any security updates planned to be released.

                            On 1 July 2004, PHP 5 was released, powered by the new Zend Engine II.[9] PHP 5 included new features such as improved support for object-oriented programming, the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension (which defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing databases), and numerous performance enhancements.[28] In 2008, PHP 5 became the only stable version under development. Late static binding had been missing from previous versions of PHP, and was added in version 5.3.[29][30]
                            Many high-profile open-source projects ceased to support PHP 4 in new code from February 5, 2008, because of the GoPHP5 initiative,[31] provided by a consortium of PHP developers promoting the transition from PHP 4 to PHP 5.[32][33]
                            Over time, PHP interpreters became available on most existing 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, either by building them from the PHP source code, or by using pre-built binaries.[34] For PHP versions 5.3 and 5.4, the only available Microsoft Windows binary distributions were 32-bit IA-32 builds,[35][36] requiring Windows 32-bit compatibility mode while using Internet Information Services (IIS) on a 64-bit Windows platform. PHP version 5.5 made the 64-bit x86-64 builds available for Microsoft Windows.[37]
                            Official security support for PHP 5.6 ended on 31 December 2018.

                            PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking native Unicode support at the core language level.[39][40] In 2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by embedding the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, and representing text strings as UTF-16 internally.[41] Since this would cause major changes both to the internals of the language and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in development.[42]
                            However, a shortage of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project.[43] As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP 6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project in its current form was officially abandoned, and a PHP 5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP 6, such as traits and closure re-binding.[44] Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but by 2014 none had been adopted.

            <h2 class="title">PHP 7</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="info">
                        <p>
                            During 2014 and 2015, a new major PHP version was developed, PHP 7. The numbering of this version involved some debate among internal developers.[45] While the PHP 6 Unicode experiment had never been released, several articles and book titles referenced the PHP 6 name, which might have caused confusion if a new release were to reuse the name.[46] After a vote, the name PHP 7 was chosen.[47]
                            The foundation of PHP 7 is a PHP branch that was originally dubbed PHP next generation (phpng). It was authored by Dmitry Stogov, Xinchen Hui and Nikita Popov,[48] and aimed to optimize PHP performance by refactoring the Zend Engine while retaining near-complete language compatibility.[49] By 14 July 2014, WordPress-based benchmarks, which served as the main benchmark suite for the phpng project, showed an almost 100% increase in performance. Changes from phpng make it easier to improve performance in future versions, as more compact data structures and other changes are seen as better suited for a successful migration to a just-in-time (JIT) compiler.[50] Because of the significant changes, the reworked Zend Engine was called Zend Engine 3, succeeding Zend Engine 2 used in PHP 5.[51]
                            Because of the major internal changes in phpng, it must receive a new major version number of PHP, rather than a minor PHP 5 release, according to PHP's release process.[52] Major versions of PHP are allowed to break backward-compatibility of code and therefore PHP 7 presented an opportunity for other improvements beyond phpng that require backward-compatibility breaks.
                            <ul>In particular, it involved the following changes:
                                <li>Many fatal or recoverable-level legacy PHP error mechanisms were replaced with modern object-oriented exceptions.</li>
                                <li>The syntax for variable dereferencing was reworked to be internally more consistent and complete, allowing the use of the operators ->, [], (),{}, and ::, with arbitrary meaningful left-side expressions.</li>
                                <li>Support for legacy PHP 4-style constructor methods was deprecated.</li>
                                <li>The behavior of the foreach statement was changed to be more predictable.</li>
                                <li>Constructors for the few classes built-in to PHP which returned null upon failure were changed to throw an exception instead, for consistency.</li>
                                <li>Several unmaintained or deprecated server application programming interfaces (SAPIs) and extensions were removed from the PHP core, most notably the legacy mysql extension.</li>
                                <li>The behavior of the list() operator was changed to remove support for strings.</li>
                                <li>Support was removed for legacy ASP-style delimiters</li>
                                <li>An oversight allowing a switch statement to have multiple default clauses was fixed.</li>
                                <li>Support for hexadecimal number support in some implicit conversions from strings to number types was removed.</li>
                                <li>The left-shift and right-shift operators were changed to behave more consistently across platforms.</li>
                                <li>Conversions between floating-point numbers and integers were changed (e.g. infinity changed to convert to zero) and implemented more consistently across platforms.</li>
                            </ul>
                            PHP 7 also included new language features. Most notably, it introduced return type declarations for functions[65] which complement the existing parameter type declarations, and support for the scalar types (integer, float, string, and boolean) in parameter and return type declarations.

                    <div class="info">
                        <p>PHP 8 was released on November 26, 2020. PHP 8 is a major version and has breaking changes from previous versions.[67][68] New features and notable changes include:
                            <h4>Just-in-time compilation</h4>
                            <ul>Just-in-time compilation is supported in PHP 8.
                                PHP 8's JIT compiler can provide substantial performance improvements for some use cases,[70][71] while PHP developer Nikita Popov stated that the performance improvements for most websites will be less substantial than the upgrade from PHP 5 to PHP 7.[72] Substantial improvements are expected more for mathematical-type operations than for common web-development use cases.[72] Additionally, the JIT compiler provides future potential to move some code from C to PHP, due to the performance improvements for some use cases.</ul>
                            <h4>Addition of the match expression</h4>
                            <ul>Main article: PHP syntax and semantics § Match
                                PHP 8 introduced the match expression.[74] The match expression is conceptually similar to a switch statement and is more compact for some use cases.[75] Because match is an expression, its result can be caught into a variable or returned from a function.</ul>
                            <h4>Type changes and additions</h4>
                            <ul>PHP 8 introduced union types, a new static return type, and a new mixed type.
                                "Attributes", often referred to as "annotations" in other programming languages, were added in PHP 8, which allow metadata to be added to classes.[67]
                                throw was changed from being a statement to being an expression.[77] This allows exceptions to be thrown in places that were not previously possible.</ul>
                            <h4>Syntax changes and additions</h4>
                            <ul>PHP 8 includes changes to allow alternate, more concise, or more consistent syntaxes in a number of scenarios. For example, the nullsafe operator is similar to the null coalescing operator ??, but used when calling methods.[78] The following code snippet will not throw an error if getBirthday() returns null:
                                Constructor property promotion has been added as "syntactic sugar," allowing class properties to be set automatically when parameters are passed into a class constructor.[67] This reduces the amount of boilerplate code that must be written.
                                Other minor changes include support for use of ::class on objects, which serves as an alternative for the use of get_class();[67] non-capturing catches in try-catch blocks; variable syntax tweaks to resolve inconsistencies; support for named arguments; and support for trailing commas in parameter lists, which adds consistency with support for trailing commas in other contexts, such as in arrays.
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Standard library changes and additions</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Weak maps were added in PHP 8. A WeakMap holds references to objects, but these references do not prevent such objects from being garbage collected.[79] This can provide performance improvements in scenarios where data is being cached; this is of particular relevance for object relational mappings (ORM).</li>
                                <li>Various adjustments to interfaces, such as adding support for creating DateTime objects from interfaces, and the addition of a Stringable interface that can be used for type hinting.</li>
                                <li>Various new functions including str_contains(), str_starts_with(), and str_ends_with();[80] fdiv(); get_debug_type(); and get_resource_id()</li>
                                <li>Object implementation of token_get_all()</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Additional changes</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Type annotations were also added into PHP's C source code itself to allow internal functions and methods to have "complete type information in reflection."</li>
                                <li>Inheritance with private methods</li>
                                <li>Abstract methods in traits improvements</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>PHP 8.1 was released on November 25, 2021. It included several improvements, such as enumerations (also called "enums"), readonly properties and array unpacking with string keys.
                            <h4>Support for enumerations</h4>
                            <ul>Support for enumerations was one of the most prominent features of PHP 8.1.[83] Enums allow developers to programmatically enforce states in their codebase. Below is an example of an enum:</ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Support for `readonly` properties was added.</li>
                                <li>After the introduction of array unpacking in PHP 7.4 with consecutive numbered keys, PHP 8.1 introduced support for array unpacking with string keys.</li>
                                <li>PHP 8.1 added support for using `new` in initializers.</li>
                                <li>A new syntax was added for creating callables.</li>
